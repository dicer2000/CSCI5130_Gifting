# gifting

A gift giving application by Brett Huffman for CMP SCI 5130 - Project 1 - V1.1

In this scenerio, I am in charge of a non-profit organization that receives donated gifts and distributes them to needy children. I am given a list of children with their ages (0 to 16 years old). I must use my considerable programming skills to determine what is the optimum distribution of gifts to the children.

## Program Switches
The program can be invoked as:
```
gifting - Gifting application by Brett Huffman for CMP SCI 5130

Usage: ./gifting inputFileName outputFileName
        Options:
        inputFileName  - the file containing child and gift info
        outputFileName - the file to write the optimum gifting distribution
```
## Install

it saved.
